# E-Commerce API with Django Rest Framework

Welcome to the **E-Commerce API** project! This repository contains a backend application built using Django and Django Rest Framework, designed to provide a robust API for an e-commerce platform. The API supports various functionalities necessary for managing an online store, including product management, user authentication, and order processing.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage user accounts with token-based authentication.
- **Product Management**: Create, update, delete, and view products with detailed information.
- **Category Management**: Organize products into categories for better navigation.
- **Cart and Order Management**: Add products to the cart, create orders, and track order status.
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways for seamless transactions (example placeholder, actual implementation may vary).
- **Admin Panel**: Manage the platform using Django's built-in admin interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: High-level Python web framework.
- **Django Rest Framework**: Powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **SQLite**: Default database for development (can be switched to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production).
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for user authentication.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy deployment.
